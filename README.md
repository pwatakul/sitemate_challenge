# Sitemate-Challenge

  

Your challenge is to create a simple REST API Server + Client for Issues (think GitHub or Jira Issues) within 2 hours.

  

Issues can be hard-coded JSON objects with just 3 attributes: id, title + description.

  

The client + server should accept or send these hardcoded JSON objects according to each API call: Create, Read, Update & Delete.

  

## Requirements

  

1. Your client and server should communicate together.

  

2. The API should be designed to be extensible.

  

3. Create a git repo in either Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket etc. Commit & push as you would for normally, we expect to see at least a few separate commits. Please share the url in the submission page

  

4. Please use Loom to record a short, 2 minutes high-level walkthrough for your solution covering the following points:

- Your technology choices

- Your API design

- Demonstrate each operation

- Any improvements you would like to make

  
  

## How to run my code

  

For running the project, pls run Backend first because backend is setting to run at port 3000 and I set frontend to call to port 3000 by hardcode. So if you run Frontend first, it will make an issue because frontend going to use port 3000.

  

Please following the steps to runs all things.

  

1. Go to backend

`cd backend`.

2. Install all dependency

`npm install`.

3. Start Backend server

`npm start`.

4. Go to frontend

`cd frontend`.

5. Install all dependency

`npm install`.

6. Start Frontend

`npm start`

  

## Frontend

  

Use React and Axios

  

## Backend

  

Use ExpressJS

  

## Developer
